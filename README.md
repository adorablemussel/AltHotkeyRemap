## Overview

A simple program that helps users whose mouse scroll button is broken. It lets you simulate the Alt key and other shortcuts, and remaps the left/right arrow keys to act as the scroll wheel. This is useful for apps like Autodesk Maya that donâ€™t let you rebind the middle mouse button inside the program :)
